# Architecture Design

In this part of my knowledge base, you will find every *architecture design* that I've found or created over my experience. Some may be known already, but I will bring my own experience and feeback about how it should or not should been implemented.

By *architecture design* , I mean every architecture decision that you will take to be able to scale easily your infrastructure.

I've grouped these architecture design into different categories that you can find below.

# Categories
